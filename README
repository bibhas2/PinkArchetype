This is an archetype to quickly create a Pink based web project.

First install the archetype by running:

mvn install

To generate a new Pink based web project, go to an appropriate folder and run:

mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=pink-archetype -DarchetypeGroupId=com.mobiarch \
  -DarchetypeVersion=1.0

The generated project is ready to run. Let's say that the artifact ID (or project name) is MyWeb. 
Then:

cd MyWeb
mvn package

Deploy target/MyWeb.war in TomEE or JBoss. Then test the URL:

curl http://localhost:8080/MyWeb/hello
